# Cursor Rules for Pupilica AI Hackathon

This folder contains rules for Cursor IDE to understand the project structure and coding standards. These rules enable Cursor to provide smarter code suggestions and generate code that follows the project architecture.

## 📁 File Structure

### `view_structure.cursorrules`
This file defines the view structure and BLoC pattern usage in the Flutter project:

- **View Folder Structure**: Each view has its own folder
- **BLoC Pattern**: Event, State, and ViewModel structure
- **OSM Components**: UI component usage
- **Logger Integration**: Logging standards
- **Navigation**: GoRouter usage

## 🎯 Purpose

With these rules, Cursor can:

1. **Code Generation**: Generate code that follows the project structure
2. **Refactoring**: Safely refactor existing code
3. **Debugging**: Better error detection
4. **Code Completion**: Provide smarter code completion suggestions
5. **Architecture Understanding**: Understand the project architecture

## 🚀 Usage

Cursor IDE automatically reads these rules and provides suggestions that follow these standards when working on the project. This ensures:

- Consistent code structure
- Fast development
- Fewer errors
- Professional code quality

## 📝 Note

These rules are specifically designed for the Pupilica AI Hackathon project and can be updated as the project evolves.
